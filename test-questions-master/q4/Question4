Question 4 - Recursive DB Query

Task:
Imagine a database that has just two different models:

1. Groups
2. People

Groups can contain people and other groups (which in turn can contain other groups and people). Such that the following is possible:

(G: Group, P: Person)

G1 contains [
	G2, G3, P1, P2, P3, P4, P5	
];

G2 contains [
	P7, P8, P9, P10
];

G3 contains [
	G4, P11
]

G4 contains [
	P12
];

Using your preferred database solution, produce a simple schema for this database as well as a query which will resolve all the people in a given group (including those people in nested groups). For instance:

SELECT PEOPLE FROM G1 AND PEOPLE FROM ANY GROUPS THAT BELONG TO G1;

Requirements:
None, feel free to use whatever database solution you prefer.

Input:
Your query should look for all people in Group 1 or any of it's descendant group (using the data above).

Output:
Your query should output P1,P2,P3,P4,P5 .. P12
